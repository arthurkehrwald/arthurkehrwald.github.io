          I work primarily as a shader programmer in a medium sized team of around 20 students and freelancers.
          Given the limited hardware capabilities of the Android based Oculus headsets, writing performant code has been essential.
          Apart from shader programming, I am in charge of dealing with the issues that arise from using a VR Headset built for a single user standing in a small room for a game that has 4 players walk around on 60 square meters.
          I've built a calibration system that aligns all headsets to the room in the same way to ensure a smooth experience without concussions.

          I was in 10th grade when I had my first contact with professional game development.
          I worked in a marketing agency for a summer internship and joined a programmer in creating a 2D browser game.
          It was a simple top-down soccer game intended to latch onto the hype around the then upcoming european championship.
          I created UI and game assets in photoshop and tried my best to understand what my programmer was doing.
          While the game never made it into proper production, it was a valuable insight into the field and a key inspiration to pursue game development professionally.

            I am currently enrolled in a seven semester Bachelor's program at the Cologne Game Lab.
            It is interdisciplinary, with students choosing to specialize in Game Design, Game Art or Game Programming.
            Every semester I have been developing a game from start to finish in a small group, building a decent amount of experiece with different technologies and different people.
            Teaching contents include C++ and C#, data structures, networking, AI and graphics programming.
            Seminars and courses are taught in English and there are many international students.

            During my studies at CGL, through game jams and personal projects, I've worked with quite a few different technologies.
            As far as programming languages go, I am most familiar with C#, but I also know my way around C++ and Java.
            I am very familiar with Unity and Godot and have recently learned the fundamentals of shader programming with HLSL in both engines.
            I've experimented with HTML5 browser games and am currently working on my web development skills.
            After that, I have plans to turn the experimental terminal game from my portfolio into an android app with a proper UI.
